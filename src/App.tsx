    content: `
      Ethereum 2.0 (hereinafter referred to as ETH2) is the upcoming major upgrade to Ethereum Mainnet. It refers to a set of interconnected upgrades that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. These upgrades are being built by multiple teams from across the Ethereum ecosystem.
      The following are the broad design goals for ETH2:
      to minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency
      to remain live through major network partitions and when very large portions of nodes go offline
      to select all components such that they are either quantum secure or can be easily swapped out for quantum secure counterparts when available
      to utilize crypto and design techniques that allow for a large participation of validators in total and per unit time
      to allow for a typical consumer laptop with O(C) resources to process/validate O(1) shards (including any system level validation such as the beacon chain)

    content: `
      Flash Loans allow developers access to undercollateralized loans, provided that the borrowed amount (and fee) is returned within one transaction block.
      Flash Loans offer a wide range of use cases, including democratized liquidations, arbitrage, collateral swapping and interest rate swapping.
      Our Flash Loans feature is very similar to AAVE Flash Loans V1, except C.R.E.A.M. Flash Loans are implemented on crToken.
      There are 3 major differences between C.R.E.A.M. Flash Loans and AAVE v1 Flash Loans:
      Using C.R.E.A.M. Flash Loans devs interact with flashLoanLender contract , instead of the lending pool.
      C.R.E.A.M has deployed two flashLoanLenders that conform to EIP-3156; one for Lending and one for IronBank.
      Fee is cheaper. C.R.E.A.M. fee is 0.03%
